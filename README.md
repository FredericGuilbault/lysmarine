# Lysmarine - A libre nav station for Raspberrypi

> * Reliable, Coherent and Open-source  :heart:  *

<br>
Lysmarine is build with the stability of the raspbian operating system to provide an easy to use lightweight and integrated toolkit for chartplotting and sensors. As it's expected to be used offshore by non-techy people, reliablility, simplicity and autonomy is at the core of the design.

## Download & install
Lysmarine is still in the early stage, there is no lysmarine.iso image you can just put on a SD card yet. You have to refer to the lysmarine-gen repository and expect rough edges.  

__Please refer to documentation for the build/install procedure.__
