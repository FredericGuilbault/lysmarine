# Lysmarine
## A libre navigation OS for Raspberrypi
Lysmarine is build with the stability of the raspbian operating system to provide an easy to use lightweight and integrated toolkit for chartplotting and sensors. As it's expected to be used offshore by non-techy people, reliablility, simplicity and autonomy is at the core of the design.
